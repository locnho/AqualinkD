## AqualinkD new home
AqualinkD has grown over the years and now has multiple repositories for software / hardware. We are brining them all together under one organization. [AqualinkD home page (under construction)](https://www.aqualinkd.com) -or- [AqualinkD organization](https://github.com/aqualinkd).<br>
AqualinkD will always be open source and so will every associated repository. Nothing will change from that perspective. You will always be able to run this on cheap off the shelf hardware.

* Changes for Docker
* Updated simulator code base and added new simulators for AllButton, OneTouch & PDA.
  * <aqualinkd.ip>/allbutton_sim.html
  * <aqualinkd.ip>/onetouch_sim.html
  * <aqualinkd.ip>/aquapda_sim.html
    * On PDA only panel AqualinkD has to share the same ID with the PDA simulator. Therefore for AqualinkD will not respond to commands while simulator is active.
* Now you can completely program the control panel with the simulators removing the need to have Jandy device.   

# Update in Release 2.3.3 (May 30 2024)
* Introduced Aqualink Manager UI http://aqualink.ip/aqmanager.html
  * [AqualinkD Manager](https://github.com/aqualinkd/AqualinkD/wiki#AQManager)
* Moved logging into systemd/journal (journalctl) from syslog
  * [AqualinkD Log](https://github.com/aqualinkd/AqualinkD/wiki#Log)
* Updated to scheduler
  * [AqualinkD Scheduler](https://github.com/aqualinkd/AqualinkD/wiki#Scheduler)
* Introduced RS485 frame delay / timer. 
  * Improve PDA panels reliability (PDA pannels are slower than RS panels)
  * Potentially fixed Pentair VSP / SWG problems since Pentair VSP use a different protocol, this will allow a timed delay for the VSP to post a status messages. Seems to only effect RS485 bus when both a Pentair VSP and Jandy SWG are present.
  * Add ```rs485_frame_delay = 4``` to /etc/aqualinkd.conf, 4 is number of milliseconds between frames, 0 will turn off ie no pause.
* PDA Changes to support SWG and Boot.

# Update in Release 2.3.2 (Jul 8 2023)
* Added support for VSP on panel versions REV 0.1 & 0.2

# Update in Release 1.3.6
* Can now debug inline from a web ui. (http://aqualinkd.ip.address/debug.html)
* Fix SWG in homekit sometimes displaying wrong value. Note to Homekit users, Upgrading to 1.3.5c (and above) will add an aditional SWG PPM tile, (look in default room). You'll need to update homebridge-aqualinkd to 0.0.8 (or later) to remove the old PPM tile (or delete you homebridge cache). This is due to a bug in homebridge-aqualinkd < 0.0.7 that didn't delete unused tiles.
* Logic for SWG RS486 checksum_errors.
